# Grungle Cup
A Blood Bowl League website PERN side project. 
A website for a blood bowl tournament. The Grungle Cup. What are the features I would like to build?
- Hero sized League Table with the upto date results.
- Teams section
- Match Reports (a general summary with a photo/s and the important stat outcomes of the game)
- About
- Merch? somewhere down the pipeline? Stickers, t-shirt. Novelty fanfare.

I could make a static vanilla js site and it would probably work quite well with a bit of styling.
But for this project I would like to build it with React. I want to create a snappy responsive SPA.
The backend will handle all the table data, the frontend a clean user friendly experience.
